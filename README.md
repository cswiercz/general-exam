General Examination
===================

My general exam titled "Computing with Riemann Surfaces and Abelian
Functions".

Abstract
--------

The goal of my research is to use the theory of Riemann surfaces and
Abelian functions to address different application problems and to
develop the software tools necessary for computing with these objects.

Abelian functions are periodic functions of $n$ complex variables
having $2n$ independent periods. Although Abelian functions first
arose in the study of Abelian integrals, they find application in many
fields of mathematics such as solving non-linear integrable partial
differential equations, complex algebraic geometry, optimization, and
more. Algebraic curves and Riemann surfaces form a natural environment
for studying these functions.

In my general examination, I will present the basic theory and
algorithms involved in computing with these objects, demonstrate the
implementation of these algorithms in the Python software library
"abelfunctions" I developed, and present my objectives for this
research.
