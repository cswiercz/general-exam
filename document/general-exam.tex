\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The goal of my research is to use the theory of Riemann surfaces and
Abelian functions to address different application problems and to
develop the software tools necessary for computing with these objects.

Abelian functions are periodic functions of $n$ complex variables having
$2n$ independent periods. Although Abelian functions first arose in the
study of Abelian integrals, they find application in many fields of
mathematics such as solving non-linear integrable partial differential
equations, complex algebraic geometry, optimization, and more. Algebraic
curves and Riemann surfaces form a natural environment for studying
these functions.

In my general examination, I will present the basic theory and
algorithms involved in computing with these objects, demonstrate the
implementation of these algorithms in the Python software library
``abelfunctions'' I developed, and present my objectives for this
research.
