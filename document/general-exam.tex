\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The goal of my thesis is to develop the software tools necessary for
computing with complex algebraic curves, Riemann surfaces and Abelian
functions: periodic meromorphic functions $f : \CC^g \to \CC$ with $2g$
independent periods. Although Abelian functions first arose in the study
of Abelian integrals, they find application in solving non-linear
integrable partial differential equations, complex algebraic geometry,
and optimization. Algebraic curves and Riemann surfaces form the natural
environment for studying these functions. The purpose of this document
is to present the theory and algorithms going into these computations,
demonstate the implementation of these algorithms in the Python software
library {\tt abelfunctions (http://www.cswiercz.info/abelfunctions)},
and present my goals for this research.
