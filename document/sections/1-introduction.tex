The Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation is a partial differential
equation used to describe the surface height of a two-dimensional
periodic shallow water wave. Depending on certain physical
considerations, which we will ignore, one can derive either of the
following two equations
\begin{align}
  \left(-4u_t + 6uu_x + u_{xxx}\right)_x + 3\sigma^2 u_{yy} = 0, \quad
  \sigma^2 = -1, \label{eqn: KP1} \\
  \left(-4u_t + 6uu_x + u_{xxx}\right)_x + 3\sigma^2 u_{yy} = 0, \quad
  \sigma^2 = +1, \label{eqn: KP2}
\end{align}
where $u(x,y,t)$ is the surface height as a function of position $(x,y)$
and time $t$. In the sequel we do not rely on this distinction and we
simply refer to the {\it KP equation}.

The KP equation admits a large family of quasiperiodic solutions of the
form
\begin{equation} \label{eqn: kpsol}
  u(x,y,t) = 2 \partial_x^2 \log \theta(Ux+Vy+Wt+z_0, \Omega) + c,
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the Riemann theta function.

\begin{definition} \label{def: riemanntheta}
  The {\bf Riemann theta function} $\theta: \CC^g \times \hh_g \to \CC$
  is defined in terms of its Fourier series:
  \begin{equation} \label{eqn: riemanntheta}
    \theta(z,\Omega) = \sum_{n \in \ZZ^g}
    e^{2 \pi i \left( \tfrac{1}{2} n \cdot \Omega n + n \cdot z \right)}.
  \end{equation}
  This function converges absolutely and uniformly on compact sets in
  $\CC^g \times \hh_g$ where $\hh_g$ is the space of all {\it ``Riemann
    matrices''} --- complex symmetric matrices with positive definite
  imaginary part.
\end{definition}

From the definition, we see that the Riemann theta function is periodic
in $z$ with integer periods and quasi-periodic in $z$ in the columns of
$\Omega$. In other words, if $m,n \in \ZZ^g$ then
\begin{equation} \label{eq: quasiperiodicity}
    \theta(z + m + \Omega n, \Omega) =
    e^{-2 \pi i \left( \tfrac{1}{2} n \cdot \Omega n + n \cdot z \right) }
    \theta(z, \Omega).
\end{equation}

A generalization of the Riemann theta function, involving a non-integer
shift in some of its arguments, is referred to as the Riemann theta
function with characteristics.

\begin{definition} \label{def: thetachar}
Let $\alpha,\beta \in [0,1)^{g}$. The {\bf Riemann theta function with
characteristic $\thcharsm{\alpha}{\beta}$} is defined as
\begin{align*}
  \theta\thchar{\alpha}{\beta}(z, \Omega) &=
  \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}^g}
  e^{2 \pi i \left( \tfrac{1}{2} (n+\alpha) \cdot \Omega (n+\alpha) +
    (n + \alpha) \cdot (z + \beta) \right) } \\
  &=
  e^{2\pi i \left( \tfrac{1}{2} \alpha \cdot \Omega \alpha +
    \alpha \cdot (z + \beta) \right)}
  \theta(z + \Omega \alpha + \beta, \Omega).
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

Note that $\theta \thcharsm{0}{0}(z,\Omega) = \theta(z,\Omega)$. See
\cite{NIST:DLMF,MumfordI07,MumfordII07} for further definitions and
properties of the Riemann theta function.

These solutions \eqref{eqn: kpsol} are the so-called {\it finite genus
  solutions} to the KP equation and families of such solutions exist for
every $g > 0$. In fact, the totality of solutions of this form are dense
the space of all periodic solutions to KP \cite{Krichever93}. The
constants $c\in\CC$, $U,V,W,z_0 \in \CC^g$ and $\Omega \in \hh_g$, as
well as the {\it genus} $g$, are determined from a Riemann surface. Any
such Riemann surface can produce a family of solutions to KP
\cite{Dubrovin81}. We postpone the definition of these constants in
terms of known quantities until more machinery is developed in the
following sections.

In general, periodic solutions to integrable partial differential
equations are {\it Abelian functions}.
\begin{definition} \label{def: abelian-function}
  An {\bf Abelian function} $f : \CC^g \to \CC$ of genus $g \geq 1$ is a
  meromorphic function such that there exists $2g$ vectors
  $w_1,\ldots,w_{2g} \in \CC^g$ linearly independent over the real
  numbers where
  \[
      f(z + w) = f(z),
  \]
  for all $z \in \CC^g$. When $g=1$ these are the {\it elliptic
    functions}.
\end{definition}
Abelian functions first arose from the study of Abelian integrals
\[
    \int_{z_0}^{z_1} \frac{P(z,w)}{Q(z,w)}dz,
\]
where $P,Q \in \CC[z,w]$ and $z$ and $w$ are related by an algebraic
equation $f(z,w) = 0$ with $f \in \CC[z,w]$.

Riemann theta functions play a central role in the theory of Abelian
functions in that all Abelian functions can be written as a rational
function of the Riemann theta function and its derivatives (such as in
the KP solution above).  The primary focus of my study is the
construction and numerical evaluation of these Abelian functions,
particularly those arising in applications.

Abelian functions are applicable in fields other than nonlinear water
waves. For example, they make explicit many computations such as those
in the study of solitary waves, black hole space-times, and algebraic
curves. One basic example is the calculation of bitangent lines of plane
algebraic curves; these are useful for computations in
optimization-related fields such as algebraic geometry and convex
optimization. Bitangents can used to represent smooth complex plane
quartic curves as either a symmetric determinant of a linear form or as
a sum of three squares \cite{PSV11}. In convex optimization, bitangents
are used to construct a {\it visibility complex} which, in turn, is used
to solve the shortest path problem in Euclidean space
\cite{PocchiolaVegter93}.

\begin{definition} \label{def: bitangent}
  A {\bf bitangent} to a plane algebraic curve $C : f(x,y) = 0, f \in
  \CC[x,y]$ is a line $\mathcal{L} \subset \CC$ that lies tangent to $C$
  at at least two distinct points.
\end{definition}

By Bezout's Theorem, if a curve has a bitangent it necessarily must be
of degree at least four \cite{Bezout1779}. A result of Pl\"{u}cker
determines that a degree four complex curve admits exactly 28 complex
bitangents \cite{Plucker34}. In particular, Pl\"{u}cker showed that the
number of real bitangents of any real quartic must be 28, 16, or fewer
than 9. The connection between Riemann theta functions and the bitangent
lines of smooth quartics was known to Riemann \cite{Baker97,Riemann76}
and, in fact, can be computed using the tools developed in this
research. See Figure \ref{fig: edge} for an example.

    grey). Note that four of them lie tangent to $C$ at infinity. These
    lines were computed using the Riemann theta function.}

Finally, Riemann theta functions and algebraic curves can be used to
compute linear matrix representations of algebraic curves. A theorem
from classical algebraic geometry states that every homogenous
polynomial $f \in P^2\CC[x_0,x_1,x_2]$ can be written in the form
\[
   f(x_0,x_1,x_2) = \text{det}
   \left( A x_0 + B x_1 + C x_2 \right),
\]
where $A,B,C$ are symmetric complex matrices which can be efficiently
computed using Riemann theta functions. Furthermore, when the polynomial
has real coefficients then $A,B,C$ are symmetric real matrices and such
representations are important in the study of spectrahedra --- the
solution spaces of semidefinite programs \cite{PSV10}.

The purpose of my research is to develop efficient and performant
algorithms for computing with Abelian functions on Riemann surfaces. The
computational tools developed in this research program have far-reaching
and varied applications.
